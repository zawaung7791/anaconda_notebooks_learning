# Introduction to Data Visualization with Python

## Description  
Data visualization is an essential part of data science and data analytics. It is a critical skill for data professionals and anyone who works with data. Remember: “Pictures speak louder than words.” Our brain processes visual information faster than words. Data visualization allows us to use graphical representation of data to communicate information effectively. 

This course will help you learn the essential data visualization concepts and tools, focusing on creating static, non-interactive figures and charts. We will learn the most popular and fundamental Python visualization tool Matplotlib. Focusing on the convenient Matplotlib interface provided by Pandas, and on high-level statistical plotting provided by Seaborn. We will learn how to understand the patterns and relationships of your data through different plotting techniques. We will walk through a visualization project together to understand the research and preparation work needed for a complete project. Plus, apply the visualization skills we have learned to solve real-world problems. 


## By the end of this live, hands-on online course, you’ll understand:
- Describe basic concepts of data visualization using Python. 
- Explain your data through visualization. 
As well as how to: 
- Visualize a Pandas Dataframe using the Pandas .plot() method.
- Use statistical plots and facet plots with Seaborn. 
- Using Matplotlib’s object-oriented API to fine-tune and customize plots.

## And you’ll be able to:

- Use a Jupyter notebook start a visualization project. 
- Use  pandas .plot, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to build data visualizations.

## This training is for you because
- You’re a student wanting to learn about Python visualization.
- You’re interested in learning how to effectively visualize information. 
- You want to become a data analyst or a data scientist.

## Prerequisites  What prior knowledge or experience is necessary?
- An understanding of Python, including lists, variables, and functions. 
- An understanding of Jupyter Notebook/Jupyter Lab. 
- Basic knowledge of Pandas is recommended, but not required. 
- Basic knowledge of statistics is recommended, but not required. 

## Recommended preparation  
- Set up a Python environment of your choice. The instructions will be using Conda.
- Introduction to Python (course link TK)

## Recommended follow-up  Links to content on Nucleus?  
- Read [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) documentation (interactive plots using the same .plot() API you learned here!)
- Try the  [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org/) tutorial (builds on the material covered here for more advanced plotting) 
- Read [The Easiest Way to Create an Interactive Dashboard blog post](https://anaconda.cloud/easiest-interactive-dashboard) on Nucleus 
- Read [Python Dashboarding Landscape blog post](https://anaconda.cloud/dashboardlandscape) on Nucleus
- Visit [PyViz.org](https://PyViz.org) for links and overviews to other Python viz libraries
